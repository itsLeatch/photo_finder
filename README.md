**Photo Finder** is a fun party game for friend groups. You can create a private room and start playing without making an account. Everyone plays with the same secret word, which stays the same throughout the game—except for one player, the imposter.

Players take photos related to the secret word. The imposter doesn’t know the word and must figure it out by studying the others’ photos. Photos shouldn’t be too obvious, but if they’re too unrelated, they may look suspicious.

After all photos are submitted, players vote on who they think the imposter is. Voting can happen over several rounds. If the group correctly identifies the imposter, they win. If the imposter figures out the secret word before being caught, the imposter wins.
